# README.md

## Description

This is a README.md Generator that is deployed through the integrated terminal using Node.js for an assignment from a bootcamp course I am currently enrolled in.

## Installation

Open integrated terminal under the index.js file in VS code, or a code editor of your choosing, and run 'npm install inquirer' before running the application.

## Usage

When the inquirer package is installed you must run 'node index.js' inside the integrated terminal to start the code, fill in the questions and statements that are prompted inside the terminal. Once you complete the application your input will create a professional README.md file inside your local repository and a string saying "README file has been created!" which will indicate a successful execute.
